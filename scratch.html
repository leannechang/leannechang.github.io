        <b><h2>Aztec Run is a single-player game where the goal is to catch as many coins as you can while simultaneously dodging the evil snails.</h2></b>
        <h3>1. Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.</h3>
        <p>My partner and I utilized the concept of if-then statements in our scratch game, including scripts such as if a character were to touch
        a certain sprite, then a live will be lost. We also condensed our character's movement script into a single variable titled "move" so it would
        be easier to work with.</p>
        <h3>2. Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?</h3>
        <p>There were many struggles my partner and I came across while working on this project, such as adding a "lives" variable
        and ensuring that the character's actions corresponded to the visible lives remaining. We solved this problem by researching different algorithms others
        have used in their scratch games and utilizing them as a reference, and if that didn't work out, we would ask Ms. Nguyen for help :)</p>
        <h3>3. What aspects of your game do you like best?</h3>
        <p>I really like the look of our game, especially our character and stage backgrounds.</p>
        <h3>4. If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?</h3>
        <p>I would work on the playability of our game, as well as maybe adding music in the background while the game is being played.
        I would also want to work on the details of the game to make it become more entertaining, such as adding different costumes to our sprites
        and sprucing up our stage backgrounds.</p>
